# Nix Home

Welcome to my Nix experiment! This is where I'm trying to tame the wild west of my system configuration using Nix and Home Manager. If you're tired of your ~/. looking like a dump for random config files, you're in the right place!

## What's This All About?

- Turning my chaotic system setup into a well-oiled Nix machine
- Managing my dev environment without losing my mind
- Making sure my ROS robots don't revolt due to inconsistent environments

## The Dream

- One command for all environment changes
- Clone, run, and voilà – my perfect setup on any machine
- Never hear "But it works on my machine!" again (okay, maybe sometimes)

## Current Status

- [x] Installed Nix
- [x] Created this repo
- [ ] Actually figured out how to use Nix
- [ ] Achieved dotfile enlightenment

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo (you're already winning)
2. Install Nix and Home Manager (good luck, you've got this!)
3. Run `home-manager switch` and cross your fingers
4. If it works, please tell me how you did it

## What's Inside

- Probably some half-baked Nix expressions
- A sprinkle of Home Manager magic
- A bunch of TODO comments

## Contributions

Found a better way to do something? Know how to make this actually work? Pull requests are welcome!

## Disclaimer

I'm about 60% sure I know what I'm doing. Use at your own risk, but hey, that's half the fun, right?
